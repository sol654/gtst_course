1. **Research/Investigation Phase**: identify **potential vulnerabilities, weak points**, or ways to exploit human behaviors.
2. **Hook Phase**: **make contact** and **building trust** with the target, often under a **false Identity**.
3. **Play Phase**: Exploiting the trust and malicious act.
4. **Exit Phase**: tracks to avoid detection and clearing History.


## Types of Social Engineering

Based on how we Perform the social engineering attack, it is classified into many kinds. 
1. **Phishing** 
2. **Vishing** 
3. **Shoulder Surfing** 
4. **Dumpster Diving** 
5. **Pretexting** 
6. **Baiting** 
7. **Scareware** 
8. **Eavesdropping**


## 1. Phishing

- Tricking people into providing sensitive information, such as passwords or credit card numbers.
- done through email, social media or malicious websites, links.
- They looks like they are from a **legitimate** company or website.

# Prevention ways

- ● Employee Awareness 
- ● Multi Step Verification

	- ○ HUMAN BEINGS(HOSTS)
- **Here**, the Vulnerable Side we got on those companies is The users/the host so here we can use the social engineering attacks.
- **Lets Hack using Social Engineering**…-> Which Social Engineering Type is Suitable for this Purpose?


# The Social Engineering Toolkit(`setoolkit`).

- **`setoolkit`**: is a social engineering tool what helps to clone websites and more.
- It is pre-built on kali and parrot.
- ○ type `sudo setoolkit` on linux terminal 
- ○ `exit` to quit the setoolkit.
- Only to check the existance click: `setoolkit`

```
To hack the credentials and passwords of someone's social media account, do the follwing steps. enter each steps:

1st>>            sudo setoolkit
then select>>    @1) Social-engineering Attack
then select>>    @2) Website Attack vectors
then select>>    @3) credential Harvester Attack Method

After these steps you will get:
1) Web Templates
2) Site Cloner
3) Custom Import

- If you want to steal google or twitter password select number 1.

- If you want to clone other site's login page select 2. then, pest the link of the origional site's login page.

Finally. You can get the fake site by browsing: your_private_ip:given_port
EG. if your Ip is 128.27.3.1 and the credential Harvester running port is 80
- Browse: 128.27.3.1:80
- Then, If some one enter his credentials, It will display on your terminal

```
As exit strategy, most phishing pages redirect the user to the real site.


# Automations Tools

- There are a lot of tools to do phishing.
- You can get them **from github**. 
	- ○ **`SocialPhish`** 
	- ○ **`Zphisher`**
	- ...
- **NB**. They can work in WAN network, so download them end use!! thet are best than `setoolkit`.

As you see you can have all of those social media hacked. But you may get some errors and confusions now because we haven’t seen about port forwarding.we will see in upcoming class.


# Manual Creating

- Phishing Pages are simple Webs Build For Malicious Activity.
- Therefore if you have web development Skill you can Build Your own Phishing page using web development languages (HTML,CSS,JS,PHP) and Perform the Attack.


## So…How do we hack other websites

**Websites like telegram**, they don't use username and password, they use phone number as login. So what do we do….

- Here The think we hack is the SMS code. To get this we can't just clone telegram, we just need to use social engineering.
- **Some telegram hacking scenarios**
   1. **OTP Bots** (With calling AI, Receiving pins...) ..research more.
   2. **Telegram bot based Phishing** (eg. With Scholar bots asking to enter pin..Ahun lkenlhal enter pin.. pretexting dramas)
   3. **Telegram API integrated Phishing Page** (making webrites using telegram API and stealing cookies..)  ..learn about telegram API, and Telegram API phishing..



**NB**. Read the books of Kevin Mitnick's books for advanced social engineering skills.
