## Malware attack recovery

#### Data Recovery Steps

- **Step** 1: **Restore from Backup**s: ○ Use the **most recent unaffected backup** to recover data. ○ Ensure backups are verified and clean before restoring.
- **Step** 2: **Use Recovery Tools:** Employ professional recovery tools for partially corrupted or deleted files. **EG**. **Recuva**, **EaseUS Data Recovery**, or **enterprise-grade solutions**. 
- **Step** 3: **Work with Vendors:** Engage backup and recovery solution vendors if specialized tools or expertise are needed. **eg**: **Backups from Ethio-telecom**. 
- **Step** 4: **Patch and Secure**: Update all systems and software to prevent a recurrence


## Address Ransomware-Specific Scenarios

- ● **Do Not Pay the Ransom**: Paying does not guarantee data recovery and may encourage further attacks.

- **Use Decryption Tools**: Check for **publicly available decryptors** (e.g., No More Ransom initiative). i. https://www.nomoreransom.org/en/decryption-tools.html 

- **Contact Authorities:** Report the incident to local cybercrime agencies or CERTs. 


# Malware in History

1. **Morris Worm**: o known as the Internet worm, **first computer worms** to spread via the Internet and earn notoriety in the media.

2. **ILOVEYOU Virus:** **eg**. *links in telegram..* written with VBS. viruss infected tens of millions of computers globally. 

3. **Stuxnet Worm:** even physical attacks, for Iran nuclear with USB. It is a worm and holds 4 vulnerabilities. Some experts believe this sophisticated worm was developed for years to launch a cyberattack.

4. **WannaCry**: is a ransomware which targeted **computers running the Microsoft Windows** operating system by **encrypting (locking) data** and demanding ransom payments in the **Bitcoin cryptocurrency**. 


# Python for Malware development

First we have to understand what our malware have to do. ● There are so many kinds of malware purpose 
- ○ Delete files 
- ○ Encrypt files 
- ○ Corrupt files 
- ○ …
   - **NB**. Then You can **Convert your python file to executable(exe)** by **py2exe** technics.   **Use**: (**Py2exe**, **py compiler**). or Use the linux command to change py to exe.


## Malware #1 - File deleting malware

- The algorithm is simple
- The file being deleted is based on our plan, but - if the **file needs root access** then we need to build the **rootkit** too. 
- ● For simplicity, i will show you making a simple python program that will delete files in a folder which it is opened.
- Lets create a test folder and our virus.py file
- Also let’s create some random files for test.

#### Starter

- Open your Vscode.
- Or, in linux use text editors. or
- Run: **`python`**   then you can use the terminal for python code.
- **Import os package**: `import os`   ..to: remove, rename, unlink, chdir, environ, system.. and also to: abort, access, add_all_directory, altsep, chmod, close..
- **OS package** is a module that helps us to **interact and do some Terminal commands** because as you know python is not like bash and cant run shell commands directly.
- **`os.listdir()`**     ..list files and directories.. like `ls`. but lists in list datatype.
- **`for i in os.listdir()`**   ..lists vertically.
- **`os.system()`**    ...run linux commands in python terminal. **eg**. **`os.system(echo "Hello world!")`** 
- **`os.path.isfile("Desktop")`**   ...returns False. bc Desktop is not file.
- **`os.remove()`**  ...to **remove a File**.
- **`os.removedirs()`**  ..to **remove Directory**. 
  - **NB**. For
