# Cybersecurity Fundamentals

## Types of Hackers Based on Skill Level

- **Newbie (Noob)**: Individuals with little to no technical knowledge about hacking
- **Script Kiddie**: Unskilled individuals who use pre-made scripts and tools developed by others, primarily for malicious purposes
- **Hacker**: Skilled individuals with technical knowledge but limited practical experience
- **Elite (Professional Hacker)**: Highly skilled experts with extensive experience and deep technical knowledge

## CIA Triad - Core Security Principles

- **Confidentiality**: Ensuring that information is accessible only to authorized individuals and kept secret from unauthorized access
- **Integrity**: Maintaining data accuracy and consistency, ensuring information remains unaltered and free from tampering
- **Availability**: Guaranteeing that systems and data are accessible and operational when needed by authorized users

## Phases of Hacking

1. **Reconnaissance** - Information gathering through active and passive methods (e.g., OSINT, scanning)
2. **Scanning** - Identifying vulnerabilities, services, and open ports
3. **Gaining Access** - Exploiting vulnerabilities to access target systems
4. **Maintaining Access** - Establishing persistence through backdoors for continuous access
5. **Clearing Tracks** - Erasing logs and removing evidence of intrusion

## Penetration Testing Types

- **Black-Box Testing**: Testing systems without prior knowledge - simulating an external attacker's perspective
- **White-Box Testing**: Testing systems with full knowledge and access - simulating a developer's perspective
- **Gray-Box Testing**: Testing with limited knowledge - simulating a user's perspective with some system access

## Cybersecurity Roles and Terms

- **Red Teaming (Offensive Security)**: Simulating real-world attacks to test defenses (e.g., penetration testing)
- **Blue Teaming (Defensive Security)**: Focused on protecting and defending systems against attacks
- **Security Audit**: Comprehensive evaluation of security policies, procedures, and controls
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Systematic review of security weaknesses in systems and networks
